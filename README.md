# Orbital_Trucker
A quick game about space trucking, done for GBjam 5

## Assets
A quick note: all ingame assets have been removed from GitHub (in fact, they have never been on github); this is because our Artist and Composer wish to reserve all rights to them. You will have to replace them with assets of your own (documented in core/assets/READ.ME) for the game to run; however, the final game & GBJam 5 submission (both will be executables) will contain the final assets.
